    <h2>Who am I? Where am I?</h2>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>
    
    You are an ex-soldier in the land of Ahrolsedovah (ah-roll-seh-dough-vuh). You (being an ex-soldier) are having frequent 
    flashbacks to when you were in the military. You had many great times then: raiding enemy camps, assassinations, and testing all of the 
    equipment. The king is missing, the surrounding peoples are putting pressure on your city, and to make things worse, there is a local warlord
    threatening your very existence. All you have to your name is a place to rest your head, and some basic military equipment.
    Your goal is to either: Aid the king once more and give the people hope, take out the local warlord and replace him, or 
    give in to the surrounding peoples and surrender. Your choice.
    
    </p>

    <h2>How do I Make Money?</h2>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>
    
    In a city with a collapsing economy, there are a few ways to make money around here, but little that make good money.
    The best ways are to do contracts for the Blades and or the Dovah. The Blades are the military arm of the vanished king, 
    and the Dovah are the local warlord's sympathizers. They will have you capture enemy territory, raid stashes, take out 
    enemy groups, and carry out assassinations. The higher the difficulty/death rate the job, the more 
    <em data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="The in-game currency">paar</em> you will be paid. 
    
    </p>
    
    <br>
    
    <h2>How do I Acquire Weapons and Equipment?</h2>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>
    
    With this new found <em data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="The in-game currency">paar</em>,
    you probably want something better than a regular pistol (Spring).
    The Armsdealer makes big money off of the current struggles. Here you can purchase or be rented anything
    on the market. There are: Shotguns, Semi-Auto Pistols, SMGs, Assault Rifles, Sniper Rifles, and the best armor money can buy. 
    Not all items and weapons can be bought though, you have to earn some in events. If you do not want to buy weapons, you can find or buy
    certain items to craft yourself some equipment. Be careful though, it will break 2-4 times more often.
    
    </p>
    
    <br>
    
    <h2>What Should I Bring?</h2>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>
    
    You should bring: any airsoft guns that you are willing to part with for a few hours, any .20 or .25 gram bbs that you 
    are willing to spare, eye protection, body protection (pants and a jacket for example), a good attitude.
